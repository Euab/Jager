A cool bot for Discord.

> I am taking an extended break from this stuff. I will respond to PRs but it may be slow.

Please do not try to host your own instance of this bot. Just invite it by calling the `invite` command on the
[official Discord server](https://discord.gg/TzDbESZ).

## Getting started
By default. RickBot's prefix is `!`. This can be changed at anytime by writing `!prefix <new prefix>`.
After that you can invoke commands with the new prefix.
The prefix can consist of any alphanumeric character.

To get help with a command type `!help <command name>` and the bot will show you the arguments to pass along with the command.
