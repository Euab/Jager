# Backstory
This bot used to be called The Oofster. I worked on it for around six months
where I made many of the plugins that its users enjoyed such as music functions.
But, due to my now existent social life (ha, get it programmers have no life)
I didn't have much time to work on the bot. I just became very busy, I still am
in a way. But, this is just something for me to do in my spare time. Winters are
usually boring.
